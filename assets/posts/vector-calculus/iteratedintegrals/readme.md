# Iterated Integrals Animation

**Goal:** Create an animation that demonstrates the process of iterated integration in 2D and 3D (seperately). For each step (dimension) of the integration, the animation will show the volume sliced in that that dimension. The slice(s) will become the focus and the rest of the volume will become transparent. Then the process will repeat on the slice for the remaining steps.
